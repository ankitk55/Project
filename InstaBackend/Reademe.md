###  Conclusion
This is an Instagram Backend project that consists of many entities:  User, Post,Comment,Like,follow .From this project a valid User can do the CRUD operations with the entities.
In this project I used passwordEncryptor which save the password in database in hashCode.
This Project provide a email Authentication when a user sign in his Account , a Token received that user mail.This Token will be valid when till user is sign in his Account after sign out the token will be expired.
With the help of token the valid user can do CRUD operations .
The project utilizes different types of mappings between these entities to establish relationships and functionality within the system.
And unregistered User can't do antthing.
