###  Conclusion
This is an Doctor App project that consists of many entities: Admin, Patients, Appointments, Doctor .This Project doing some CRUD operations on those entities.
In this project I used passwordEncryptor which save the password in database in hashCode.
This Project provide a email Authentication when a Patient sign in a Token received that user mail.This Token will be valid when till user is sign in after sign out the token will be expired.
With the help of token the user can do different operations .

The project utilizes different types of mappings between these entities to establish relationships and functionality within the system.
